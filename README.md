# FakeNewsGenerator

In this project, we explored how to generate text using a character-based RNN. 

We got our news data from https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news, which includes 142,570 news articles.

We were able to use an RNN model with multiple GRU layers to create a model that generates fake news given some phrase of words.

The Flask web app is built on top of the model and is hosted on: https://fakenews-cc.appspot.com/
